-- * Read time information

-- | Read the environment variable, i.e. the 'TimeInfo'.
timeInfo :: Monad m => SyncSF m cl a (TimeInfo cl)
timeInfo = arrM_ ask

{- | Utility to apply functions to the current 'TimeInfo',
such as record selectors:
@
printAbsoluteTime :: SyncSF IO cl () ()
printAbsoluteTime = timeInfoOf absolute >>> arrMSync print
@
-}
timeInfoOf :: Monad m => (TimeInfo cl -> b) -> SyncSF m cl a b
timeInfoOf f = arrM_ $ asks f

  time      <- timeInfoOf absolute -< ()
  startTime <- keepFirst           -< time
  returnA                          -< time `diffTime` startTime

-- | Continuously return the tag of the current tick.
theTag :: Monad m => SyncSF m cl a (Tag cl)
theTag = timeInfoOf tag


-- * Useful aliases

-- TODO Is it cleverer to generalise to Arrow?
{- | Alias for 'Control.Category.>>>' (sequential composition)
with higher operator precedence, designed to work with the other operators, e.g.:

> syncsf1 >-> syncsf2 @@ clA **@ sched @** syncsf3 >-> syncsf4 @@ clB

The type signature specialises e.g. to

> (>->) :: Monad m => SyncSF m cl a b -> SyncSF m cl b c -> SyncSF m cl a c
-}
infixr 6 >->
(>->) :: Category cat
      => cat a b
