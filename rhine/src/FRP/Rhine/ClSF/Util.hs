-- * Read time information

-- | Read the environment variable, i.e. the 'TimeInfo'.
timeInfo :: Monad m => ClSF m cl a (TimeInfo cl)
timeInfo = arrM_ ask

{- | Utility to apply functions to the current 'TimeInfo',
such as record selectors:
@
printAbsoluteTime :: ClSF IO cl () ()
printAbsoluteTime = timeInfoOf absolute >>> arrMCl print
@
-}
timeInfoOf :: Monad m => (TimeInfo cl -> b) -> ClSF m cl a b
timeInfoOf f = arrM_ $ asks f

-- | Continuously return the time difference since the last tick.
sinceTickS :: Monad m => ClSF m cl a (Diff (Time cl))
sinceTickS = timeInfoOf sinceTick

-- | Continuously return the time difference since clock initialisation.
sinceInitS :: Monad m => ClSF m cl a (Diff (Time cl))
sinceInitS = timeInfoOf sinceInit

-- | Continuously return the absolute time.
absoluteS :: Monad m => ClSF m cl a (Time cl)
absoluteS = timeInfoOf absolute

-- | Continuously return the tag of the current tick.
tagS :: Monad m => ClSF m cl a (Tag cl)

{- |
Calculate the time passed since this 'ClSF' was instantiated.
This is _not_ the same as 'sinceInitS',
which measures the time since clock initialisation.

For example, the following gives a sawtooth signal:

@
sawtooth = safely $ do
  try $ sinceStart >>> proc time -> do
    throwOn () -< time > 1
    returnA    -< time
  safe sawtooth
@

If you replace 'sinceStart' by 'sinceInitS',
it will usually hang after one second,
since it doesn't reset after restarting the sawtooth.

sinceStart :: (Monad m, TimeDomain time) => BehaviourF m time a (Diff time)

  startTime <- keepFirst -< time
  returnA                -< time `diffTime` startTime


-- * Useful aliases

-- TODO Is it cleverer to generalise to Arrow?
{- | Alias for 'Control.Category.>>>' (sequential composition)
with higher operator precedence, designed to work with the other operators, e.g.:

> clsf1 >-> clsf2 @@ clA ||@ sched @|| clsf3 >-> clsf4 @@ clB

The type signature specialises e.g. to

> (>->) :: Monad m => ClSF m cl a b -> ClSF m cl b c -> ClSF m cl a c
-}
infixr 6 >->
(>->) :: Category cat
      => cat a b

      -> cat a b
      -> cat a   c

{- | Output a constant value.
Specialises e.g. to this type signature:

arr_ = arr . const
