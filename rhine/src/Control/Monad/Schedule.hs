This module supplies a general purpose monad transformer
that adds a syntactical "delay", or "waiting" side effect.

This allows for universal and deterministic scheduling of clocks
that implement their waiting actions in 'ScheduleT'.
See 'FRP.Rhine.Schedule.Trans' for more details.

Values in @ScheduleT diff m@ are delayed computations with side effects in 'm'.
Delays can occur between any two side effects, with lengths specified by a 'diff' value.
These delays don't have any semantics, it can be given to them with 'runScheduleT'.
